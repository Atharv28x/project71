                    <p class="p_modal">Welcome to a school of difference! At, Sou. Vijayadevi Yadav English Medium School we value your children as the world of tomorrow. So when it comes to helping them with the academic learning or the extra-curricular activities, we always deem them as important as the small sapling that we plant in a garden. We create the necessary conducive soil for the growth of that sapling. We give your children the best of environment to grow and develop. Just as the sapling requires constant nurturing of water, proper manure and sunlight. So our teachers in the school educate your children with the right kind of knowledge and learning that is deeply value based and anchored in the virtues of love, mutual respect and growth.
                    We also believe that knowledge is not just filling of the bucket, but rather as the root meaning of the word ‘education’ says, ‘drawing out’. We know right education is motivating, encouraging for a growth from inside- out. The necessary skills and talents hidden in your children are drawn out, shaped and promoted so that the little sapling matures and brings out flowers and fruits that attract and give joy to everyone around. We believe our real work as teachers, mentors and guides would be complete, when the children of our school will become tomorrow’s architects who will shape the nation and the universe into a place that God sees and smiles upon.
                    This seems to be a herculean vision to attempt. But as Robert Browning said, “A man’s reach should exceed his grasp or what’s heaven for.” The first requisite to do anything worthwhile is to Dream big and then the next is to follow it by worthwhile actions. We also realize that anything worthwhile cannot be achieved unless a proper synergetic effort backs it up in form of cooperative spirit from all ends. So we urge you the parents, mentors to join the hands of the management, the teachers, staff and well wishers so that we together can give your children the gift of realizing his or her dreams of a better world.
                        
                    Best Wishes.

                    <p class="p_modal">Welcome to VYEMS Family; Welcome to the New World of Possibilities!!!
        India has been recognized to be enriched with prominent educationists who believed that change is the way to forward. The wheel of time revolves constantly pushing mankind for further progress. Those who adapt will survive, those who are in sync with change will love it; but those who create the change will lead society towards progress.
        Today's tiny tots are the leaders of tomorrow. A nation's real strength is not machines and industries, not the cinema stars or the sports stars, not the values of currency notes, not the political parties that are here today and vanish tomorrow. A nation's real strength lies in the leaders with character who are ready to move mountains, who can change hearts and who can unite India for the common cause. During the course of time India produced such selfless leaders like Chh. Shivaji Maharaja, Swami Vivekananda, etc., who walked across the holy land of India and moved masses to action, lived the life of virtues and left a legacy for us to follow their royal path. VYEMS' philosophy is nothing but the lively preaching of these Real Heroes of the Nation. VYEMS easily helps children understand and practically imbibe good character and culture in their lives, thus freeing the future of India from the problems of corruption, adultery, bad habits like alcohol, smoking, extra-marital affairs, people not taking care of their old parents, conflicts based on religion caste race and selfishness.
        Childhood is one of the best gifts that a person can get from his/her life. Children play draw and create an entire new words of their own. That's how their imagination can ascend the pinnacle of creation. If they are provided with enough room to channelise their raw creativity, their high rampant impulse will also be in control. In this respect, VYEMS' creative but potent medium and research - baked works transcends cultural, linguistic and geographical boundaries. The innovative methodologies have been seemed successful to impart lessons of life to set out on a journey to add value to educational leadership.
        In order to participate in global competition effectively VYEMS prepares children to be equipped with core skills like Communication and Collaboration, Critical Thinking and Problem Solving, Creativity and Imagination, Leadership and Personal Development, Digital Literacy and Citizenship. These skills have often also been referred as life of 21st Century. VYEMS works, further, with its stakeholders to improve learning outcomes for young minds.
        We, at VYEMS prepare a child to be a global citizen with the keys of knowledge, Imagination and Innovation to unlock the door to a successful future.
